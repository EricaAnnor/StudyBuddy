# 📚 StudyBuddy

**StudyBuddy** is a robust, scalable backend system built with **FastAPI** for a learning platform that fosters collaboration through real-time messaging, user groups, and a rich social layer.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview

### 🔐 Authentication & RBAC
- JWT-based authentication for secure session management using access and refresh tokens.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) governs permissions across user groups, friendships, and administrative actions.
- Passwords hashed securely with bcrypt.

### 👥 Social Features
- Comprehensive friendship system: send, accept, reject, and remove requests.
- Group management with clear ownership, membership validation, and protected role-specific actions.

### ⚡ Real-Time Messaging
- WebSocket-based live chat system.
- Redis Pub/Sub enables multi-instance scalability, ensuring real-time delivery across distributed deployments.
- **Online presence tracking via periodic heartbeats** sent over WebSockets.
- Each client sends heartbeats at fixed intervals to signal activity.
- Users are marked "offline" automatically if no heartbeat is received within a timeout window.
- Redis handles temporary presence state for fast access across instances.

### 🔄 Asynchronous Task Processing
- Celery + RabbitMQ for background tasks like sending notifications or reminders.
- Redis used as a durable result backend.
- Built-in `NotificationLog` model guarantees reliable delivery and auditing of all async events.

### 🗂️ File Uploads
- Users can upload files (e.g., avatars, documents) via FastAPI endpoints.
- Local disk storage is used to keep the platform cost-effective in early development.
- Easily extendable to cloud solutions like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

### 🗄️ Storage Architecture
- **PostgreSQL**: used for relational data (users, groups, friendships, etc.).
- **MongoDB**: stores flexible and high-volume chat messages with indexing support.
- Follows **polyglot persistence** principles for performance and flexibility.

### 🐳 Containerized DevOps
- Fully Dockerized setup with `docker-compose` for consistent local development and deployment.
- Includes services for FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and RabbitMQ.
- Health checks and service-level dependencies ensure clean startup and operation.
